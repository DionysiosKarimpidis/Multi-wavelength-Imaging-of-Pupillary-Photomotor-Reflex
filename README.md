Abstract

Pupillography is utilized as a method in order to record changes of the pupil diameter.
Nervous System and especially Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is responsible for
controlling pupil reflexes, hence the pupil changes occur subconsciously. In this study
an innovative, low-cost and wireless imaging system device developed for pupil non-
invasive examination. The device is portable and there is also a possibility to apply
different light stimulus within the visible spectrum and analyze the behavior of the
pupil reaction. The goal of this thesis is to provide the proper device instrumentation
and a basic algorithmic method to measure reliably and objectively the pupil
diameter. For the needs of the proposed system an image processing algorithm and a
graphic user interface was developed to control the device wirelessly. Due to the
relation of pupillary reflexes and ANS, digital pupillography presents a simple and
real time window for its functionality. Pupil responses may associate with a various
pathologies such as brain or mental diseases, anxiety or autism with an uprising
research interest from various clinical studies to psychological impacting conditions.
